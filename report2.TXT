======================Git Init=======================
First, we need to push our project (from TP1) to the git repository.

#Signed in to git

#Created new git repository https://github.com/kuundyol/imp

#Opened git bash on my computer

#Moved to the root folder of my project: Users\igors\Documents\efrei\imp\tp1

#Used the init command to initialize the local directory as a Git repository. By default, the initial branch is called master.
$ git init

#Added the files in your new local repository. This stages them for the first commit.
$ git add .

#Commited the files that you've staged in your local repository.
$ git commit -m "Initial commit"

#At the top of your repository on GitHub.com's Quick Setup page, clicked to copy the remote repository URL.
https://github.com/kuundyol/imp.git

#In the Command prompt, added the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/kuundyol/imp.git
	#Sets the new remote
$ git remote -v
	#Verifies the new remote URL

#Pushed the changes in your local repository to GitHub.com.
$ git push origin master
	#Pushes the changes in your local repository up to the remote repository you specified as the origin
	#My branch be default is called 'master'

#Went to the git repository on the browser and saw that all the files are there. Success!
